# Minimal Total Conversion Naev Plugin

This is an example of a minimum plugin that is a total conversion of Naev. In particular, `plugin.xml` uses the `<total_conversion/>` node to signal to the engine that the core data should be mainly disabled.

This plugin is not intended to be truly playable. It just shows how to create a small universe with a single system and spob in which the player can fly around and do things. It can be used as a starting point for creating something significantly more interesting.

For Naev development, please refer to the [Naev Development Manual](https://naev.org/devmanual/) for more details.
